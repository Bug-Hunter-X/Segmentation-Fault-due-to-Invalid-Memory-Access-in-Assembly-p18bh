mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10]

This line of assembly code attempts to access memory at the address calculated by `[ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10]`.  The issue arises if the calculation results in an address outside the valid memory range accessible to the program. This can lead to a segmentation fault or other unpredictable behavior.
